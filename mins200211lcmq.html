South Eastern are becoming hostile. We were asked to look at possibility of an under-20's division in our league.</p>

9. Other Business.<br>
9.1. Woking United FC attended a disciplinary hearing at 19.30. because of an abandoned match against Kempton Athletic FC.
Their attitude left a lot to be desired. The club secretary was particularly arguementative and would not accept any responsibility
for the incident. The club were advised there would be no replay and the match is awarded to their opponents. It is not clear whether or
not this incident has been reported to Surrey County FA by the referee.</p>
