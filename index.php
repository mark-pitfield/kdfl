      <P class="two">This is the official site of the Kingston & District Football League, which is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association. Our clubs come from, and matches are played in, an area which covers much of South West London and Surrey. The league consists of two divisions, each with up to twelve teams in each. There are also four cup competitions - two for the teams in the top half of the league and two for the teams in the lower half. Added to this will be a cup competition provided by your affiliated County.</br></p> 

<P class="two">Clubs wishing to join the league should print off and complete the application form and then forward it to the General Secretary. Details are available in the links on the right hand side of this page. </br></p>

<p class="two">You may have found this site because you entered "players wanted" or "players needed" into a search engine. So, if you're looking for a club to join then contact a club directly. Use the relevant links on the right hand side of the page. Although our league is men's football played on Saturdays, a few of our clubs also have youth teams, veterans teams and Sunday teams. The clubs' home grounds are also included with the contact details, so you can find a club near you.</br></p>


<p class="two">The Match Cards for league and cup matches are online, so you can download and print them off. They are on the "Forms and Match Cards" page. There are links on the right hand side of each page where you'll find the league's rules and bank account details. The "Results and Fixtures" link will give a full picture of the league's football programme.</p>

<p class="two">The other website links on our Home page will take you to the external websites operated by the main Football authorities
in our immediate area who have a direct connection with the KDFL. KDFL are not responsible for the content on the external sites.</p>

<p class="two">
	Welcome to the Kingston and District Football League (KDFL) affiliated to the <a href="http://www.surreyfa.com/" target="_blank">Surrey County FA</a>.
</p>
<p class="two">
	The KDFL  provides football for amateur teams on a Saturday afternoon, and is one of the oldest Leagues in England having celebrated 125
years in 2021.
</p>
<p class="two">
	The League is an integral part of the Surrey Saturday Pyramid providing a pathway from Development for under 21 teams though to
Junior and Intermediate levels Tier 3 and Tier 2 with the opportunity to progress automatically to the Surrey Premier Tier 1 through
promotion.
</p>

<p class="two">
	By providing football for all participating teams throughout three levels to Senior status the KDFL is set up in an exclusive format to develop all Clubs 
whatever their ambitions, and to do this in a seamless way.
</p>

<p class="two">
	The KDFL provides football in the localities of North East Surrey and surrounding areas with the aim of the Surrey Pyramid to keep 
opposition close and reduce travelling as much as possible.
</p>

<p class="two">
	The League has been sanctioned to offer Cup Competitions for all three levels of football, and our finals are held under lights annually
at local venues with gated and terraced accommodation. The Teck Charity Cups are our oldest Cup competitions originating from 1912
and bestowed on us by a member of the royal family.
</p>

<p class="two">
	Membership of the Surrey Pyramid and the KDFL is an important step for local football. Now a young team of 18 year olds having outgrown  the youth teams
can join the KDFL  and progress at its own pace within the Development Divisions. Junior and Intermediate Clubs have their own Divisions with
continuing promotion options which includes the Surrey Premier.
</p>

<p class="two">
	The purpose of the KDFL is to accommodate all Saturday football teams at whatever level they want. 
If you wish to join us please contact the League Secretary Mike Hallett, or alternatively any of the League Officers listed on 
this website where full contact details are available.
